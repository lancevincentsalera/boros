## Test Items

### 1. Transaction Propagation

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that the fanout mechanism propagates transactions to peers successfully.

**Result:**  
**PASS**

**Details:**  
A high-volume transaction submission scenario was simulated, and all transactions were successfully propagated to the designated peers.

### 2. Multi-Peer Connectivity

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that the fanout mechanism connects to multiple peers simultaneously using node-to-node protocols.

**Result:**  
**PASS**

**Details:**  
The mechanism successfully established concurrent connections with multiple peers using node-to-node protocols.

### 3. Static Topology Configuration

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that a static topology can be provided via configuration and is honored by the fanout mechanism.

**Result:**  
**PASS**

**Details:**  
The mechanism correctly adhered to the static topology configuration provided, ensuring that only the specified peers were utilized.

### 4. Dynamic Topology via On-Chain Relay Data

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that a dynamic topology can be constructed automatically using on-chain relay data from pool certificates.

**Result:**  
**PASS**

**Details:**  
The mechanism dynamically updated its topology based on on-chain relay data, ensuring optimal peer selection and connection management.

### 5. Dynamic Topology via Peer Sharing

**Test Objective:**  
Verify that a dynamic topology can be constructed via p2p networking using the peer sharing mini-protocol.

**Result:**  
**PASS**

**Details:**  
The fanout mechanism successfully built a dynamic topology using the peer sharing mini-protocol, demonstrating effective p2p networking capabilities.
